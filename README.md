Implementing Graph data structure by having Edges and Vehicles where given a data file, there was Edges with their coordinates and the program calculates the coordinates to create the Graph. Then the program gives you options to calculate the Shortest Path, Minimum Spanning Tree, Breadth First Search, and Depth First Search.
